## Description of the project

Sports Responsive Landing Page || Sports App - "An Enhanced football experience"

## Process followed

In order to improve and avoid repeating the same mistakes of the [level 1](https://github.com/manuelalonge/hotel-landing-page), I chose to deeply analyze the layout before writing any line of code.Therefore I followed these steps:

1. Analyzed the Figma layout in depth
2. Understood all the parts that were recurring in the layout
3. Wrote down the recurring parts (especially styles)
4. Created macro tasks on Github projects
5. Split the macro tasks in atomic micro tasks (execution time: 10 minutes or less)
6. Started following the plan I created
